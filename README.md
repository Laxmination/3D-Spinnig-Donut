# 3D-Spinnig-Donut

## Steps 

1. Create a circle of radius R1 centered at R2
2. Create a donut by rotating about the Y axis
3. Spin the donut around the X and Z axis
4. Project donut onto 2D screen 
5. Determine illumination by calculating surface normal (given a light source)
6. <b>ASCII Luminance:</b> . , - ~ : ; = ! * # $ @
